Southern Ocean Observing System data projects


## Wish list

- shiny form for user input
- linked map for voyage plan via GeoJSON
- submit / edit for plan
- select / view by project search, geographic bound, date range, search by data type etc. 
- Make it pretty

## Promising leads

- Shiny as overarching system for web pages and publishing (Explore gallery for examples with maps you can draw in)
- explore leaflet and mapview packages in R for drawing tracks
- use dplyr and RSQLite as the data base backend
- use DT to present (and edit?) tabular data within Shiny
